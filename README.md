# Updated District Analysis (PyCitySchools_Challenge)
--------

## Overview: 

After previously calculating the results of the state testing scores for both the overall district and schools individually, we have become aware that the scores for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School appear to be altered. In order to address this issue, and ensure that our final analysis is as accurate as possible, we have chosen to remove those scores from the final analysis calculations.     


## How is the district summary affected?

After removing the invalid scores from the Thomas High School 9th grade class, the overall summary did not change much (likely because 9th graders at Thompson High School is such a small portion of the overall scores). Originally, the overall passing score was 65.172. After recalculating and rounding it to the nearest tenth, it is 64.9% overall passing rate. The original passing rate for reading was 85.8% and was lowered to 85.7% when the averages were recalculated. The original passing rate for math was 74.98% and was lowered to 74.8% after recalculating.

It is difficult to come to a conclusion about academic dishonesty for Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores based on this analysis. When omitting the 9th grade scores, Thomas High School % passing math, % passing reading and % overall passing were reduced by <1%. This is not a large enough margin to determine academic dishonesty. Further tests will need to be implemented for a stronger conclusion.
